# Room-Based-Chat-App
This project is a room-based chat application built using Node.js, TypeScript, Express, and Socket.IO. It allows users to create chat rooms, join rooms using a unique room ID, and exchange messages with other users in the same room. Rooms are automatically cleaned up when all users disconnect.
